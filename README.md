# transformed-website-new

This is the GitHub repo for the Transformation Place website.

## Getting Started

You can edit the pages by going into the `page.tsx` files in the app router (`src/app/`).<br/>
For example to edit the about page you would edit `src/app/about/page.tsx`.

Then you can run the development server to see your changes.
To run the dev server, use any of the following commands in your terminal depending on your package manager:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
